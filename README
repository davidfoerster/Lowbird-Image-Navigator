  Lowbird Image Navigator
===========================

This script is supposed to "enhance" image browsing on http://lowbird.com.

It replaces the blue navigation bars at each side of the page with
semi-transparent navigation handles placed in front of the image. These handles
only appear with a fade effect when hovered.

Furthermore it introduces a new image display size mode that fits the image
horizontally into the browser window â€“ but only for sufficently large images.
Plus, it hides ads and changes the font to the default sans-serif, if
configured to do so.

System requirements:
This works only in Firefox 3+ so far. WebKit (Konqueror and Safari) and
Chrome/Chromium should work as well, but I didn't test it. Opera 10 is all
bitchy about the "max-height" CSS property, so it doesn't work there and
probably won't until the vendor fixes that; and of course neither does Internet
Explorer 'cause no SVG support (although a plugin from Adobe may provide that
support).
